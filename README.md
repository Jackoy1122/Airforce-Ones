These shoes are already FiveM ready so put them in your [clothing] folder and off and away you go! Shoes should work with no issues! https://discord.gg/AKe6Yqs7jQ If you need any assistance join my development discord! I offer a bunch of free clothing and some support if you are ever learning to make clothing yourself!
